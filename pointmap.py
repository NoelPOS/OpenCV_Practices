The last three parameters (0, -1, 0) represent the up direction vector, indicating which direction is considered 'up' for the camera, here pointing along the negative y-axis. This setup effectively positions the camera 10 units down and 8 units back from the origin, looking towards the origin with the 'up' direction being downwards in the y-axis, which is unconventional and might be used to achieve a specific orientation or perspective in the rendered scene.
